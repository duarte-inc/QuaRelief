# QuaRelief (Quarantine Relief)

## Background
Quarantine, self-isolation and social distancing, due to COVID'19, have taken a negative toll on the mental and physical health of people around the world. Everyone has been trying to overcome the stress, by either watching motivational and inspiring videos on YouTube or by reading meaningful articles on the internet. Although there are hundreds of videos and articles on the internet regarding Mental Health, Pornography, Yoga etc, but people often tend to find it extremely difficult to find the right video or the right article for themselves. In addition, many people are facing serious mental health issues and are too shy to share their condition with others. They tend to be afraid that people will make fun of their condition or not understand them. Many people just want to talk to mere strangers and discuss their lie stories and Covid'19 affected life.
